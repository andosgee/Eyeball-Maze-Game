This project was made in two stages. Creating a model, and then creating a View.
There were two IDEs that were used in the creation of this project. The first was Eclipse IDE to write the model, the second was Android Studio to create the GUI and make it a Android Application.

For creating the model, there was a series of test cases provided that needed to be satisfied for the application to work against the test cases. These tests outlined the features that the program would require for it to be usable. These features were;
- Creating the Level
- Sizing of the Level
- Movements of the Player
- Creation, Completion, and Deletion of Goals
- Game Rules, and ensuring the player follows them (no illegal moves)

Once the model was completed, the development environment migrated into Android Studio to make the view for the application to make it a Android compatible app. The view consisted of the model, a controller for the model (handles the data entry and communication of the model and user), and XML files for the design of the application. 
The view contained several images, buttons, sounds, and user input areas that allowed for the maze to run.
