#Eyeball Maze

A game made with Android Studio written in Java. A model was developed first in Eclipse passing unit tests. The game allows for movement by touching the destination square.\
Currently there is one level hard coded in, the user can only move forwards, left, or right relative to the direction the eye is facing. It can not move backwards, diagonal, or on a square that doesn't match the colour or shape. \
The user wins when they complete the goal.
